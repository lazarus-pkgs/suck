=======
-- Changes from Suck-4.2.5 -> Suck-4.3.0

* As of this version, my e-mail address has changed from
from bobyetman@worldnet.att.net to bobyetman@home.com

* 	changes to allow it to use SSL.

* rpost.c - added -i option, to ignore the
	readonly opening response and try
	to post anyway, since inn-2.3, when
	using authinfo, still sends 201 code
	meaning readonly.

	- do_authenticate() - added print
	statements to show start of, and
	successful completion of authentication.

* suck.c - get_one_article_kill() - add test
	for header_only mode when in stdout mode 
	to not download the body.

	- get_one_article(), get_articles() - added
	 -bP option, to post articles during download.

Sep 17, 2001 - Suck-4.3.0 released

-- Changes from Suck-4.2.4 -> Suck-4.2.5

* batch.c - post_one_msg() - fixed bug in
	testing for a long input line that
	caused us to reject any line that is
	exactly 13 char long.

* chhistory_db.c - various changes to allow it
	to compile with Inn-2.3 headers.

* rpost.c - do_article() - added test for second
	duplicate article string to handle DNews.

	- filter_batch_article() - added option for
	showing the file name as we upload it.

Dec 02, 2000 - Suck-4.2.5 released

-- Changes from Suck-4.2.3 -> Suck-4.2.4

*	various changes to allow compile under OS/2
	(look for ifdef EMX).  You'll need to edit the
	Makefile to get it to compile.

*both.c - true_str(), null_str() - moved from suck.c so
	rpost can use.

* killprg.c - Changes to include so will compile using 
	Perl5.6.  If you're using perl5.004 or older,
	you'll need to define OLD_PERL in the Makefile.

* rpost.c - Changes so will compile with perl5.6.0.
  
	do_article() - Added actual error message from
	remote server to Malfunction error message, to
	make it easier to figure out problem. 

* suck.c - do_one_group() - added code for resetcounter 
	option.  If remote end resets its article numbers
	the normal suck response is to ignore the group
	and reset the lastread counter to match the current
	high counter.  This option tells suck to reset
	its lastread counter to the low counter, effectively
	causing suck to get all articles for the group, and
	use the historydb to check for dupes.
	Added low_read option. This option is used in concert
	with the maxread option of the sucknewsrc.  Normally
	when there is a maxread in the sucknewsrc, suck will
	download the newest articles.  This option tells suck
	to download instead the oldest articles.
	
	do_articles() - added code for show_group option. 
	This option will add the name of the current group
	to the BPS display as you download the articles.
        
May 21, 2000 - Suck-4.2.4 released

-- Changes from Suck-4.2.2 -> Suck-4.2.3

* both.c - signal_block() - Changes to get rid of invalid 
	#ifdef POSIX_SIGNAL causing this routine never to
	get called.

* killfile.c. parse_killfile() - fixed bug in getting perl
        filter filename.  If you didn't specify debug, the
        nl was getting left on the name, causing errors.

* rpost.c - * - Major internal re-write to handle future
	expansion of filters/batch mode.  Changed many
	function's arg passing, so they only pass around
	myargs.  Re-wrote batch mode to make adding new
	filters easier.  Added rnews mode, for reading
	rnews files.  See man page for more details.

* suck.c - main(), sighandler() - changes from signal() to
	sigaction() so I use all POSIX signal handling stuff.

        - do_nodownload() - added, this routine allows you
        to specifiy Message-IDs to never download.  See the
        SUCKNODOWNLOAD section in the man page.

23 Jan 2000 - Suck-4.2.3 released

-- Changes from Suck-4.2.1 -> Suck-4.2.2

* lmove.c match_group(), move_msgs(), scan_args() - Re-wrote
	for new options -h and -s to create hard or symbolic
	links to files crossposted to multiple groups.  Re-wrote
 	code to handle malformed header with spaces either before
	or after the newsgroup names.

	load_active() - added test for duplicate group line.

* suck.c - do_one_group() - changed command from "xhdr 111-"
	to "xhdr 111-2222" for brain-dead servers that don't
	follow the proposed standard and treat 111- correctly.

* xover.c - do_xover(), do_group_xover() - changed command from
	"xover 111-" to "xover 111-222".

25 July 1999 - Suck-4.2.2 released

-- Changes from Suck-4.2.0 -> Suck-4.2.1

* rpost.c - do_perl() - fixed bug where infile was being lost
	due to FREETMPS, causing failed posting.

* suck.c - restart_yn() - fixed bug where if prior to restart,
	we had sent command for an article, but not received it,
	then on restart, we would skip article.   So I have
	to set sentcmd to false if we haven't downloaded it.

* xover.c - chk_a_group() - rewrote into one loop, to get rid
	of segfaults on NULL field, and to speed things up for
	complicated xover files.

23 May 1999 - Suck-4.2.1 released

-- Changes from Suck-4.1.2 -> Suck-4.2.0

* active.c - get_msgids() - added new option, -i, to set the default
	number of articles to download when using the -A or -AL option
	and a new group is added.  See man page for usage.

        do_one_group() - changed handling of return from 
	do_group_xover() so handle new error code.

	parse_args(), main() - added code to handle -i option.

	get_articles() - fixed bug in handling of pause and
	reconnect after X nr of articles.  Wasn't taken into
	account 0 articles correctly.

* killfile.c - moved xoverview pointer out of master killfile and
	into master struct, so can use independently of killfiles
	(for -Z option).

	parse_killfile() - changed to passed which argument to 
	various setup routines, so can distinguish between XOVER
	and regular killfiles.

* killprg.c - killprg_forkit(), killperl_setup() - added test for
	which, so if XOVER killfiles we don't point the killfile
	functions to killprg stuff.

	- killprg_sendoverview(), killprg_sendxover, 
	killperl_sendxover() - created.  These routines handle 
	the sending of the overview.fmt and each overview line
	to a child program or perl subroutine for matching.

* suck.c - main() - added code to handle retreival and freeing up
	of memory used by overview.fmt.  Added call to free up
	xoverp killfile.u

	- do_one_group() - added code to handle new option, -Z,
	to use XOVER vice XHDR to get message-ids, in case the 
	remote server doesn't support the XHDR command.

* xover.c - do_group_xover() - changed the error code returned
	if server can't do xover command, so can recover 
	gracefully from other errors (such as too long msgid)

	get_xover(), find_msgid() - created.  These routines
	use the XOVER command to get the Message-ID and alloc
	it for the -Z option.

	Moved xoverview pointer out of master killfile and into
	master struct, so can use for -Z option.

	- do_one_line() - added code so if we have a program
	or perl subroutine to do the checking, it gets called

11 May 1999 - suck-4.2.0 released

-- Changes from Suck-4.1.1 -> Suck-4.1.2

* suck.c -- do_supplemental() - added call to do_sup_bynr().

	do_sup_bynr() - created.  Handles lines in suckothermsgs
	that specify a group name and article number for retreival.

14 Apr 1999 - suck-4.1.2 released

-- Changes from Suck-4.1.0 -> Suck-4.1.1

* suck.c - get_one_article() - fixed bug in sending command
	for the second article, was resending first article
	command.

27 Mar 1999 - suck-4.1.1 released

-- Changes from Suck-4.0.0 -> Suck-4.1.0

* killfile.c - get_one_article_kill() - added code to handle
	new option, -g, to get only the headers of articles.
	See man pages for details.

* suck.c - get_one_article() - added code to handle new option
	-g, to get only the headers of articles.

* xover.c - chk_a_group() - fix bug in counting of Xref line,
	causing inaccurate count.

        do_one_line(), get_xoverview() - fixed handling of :full
	flag in overview.fmt.

22 Mar 99 - suck-4.1.0 released

-- Changes from Suck-3.10.4 -> Suck-4.0.0

* reworked restart code.  Got rid of suck.restart and suck.sorted,
   replaced with suck.db, which contains the records of all messages.
   All of this code is now contained in db.c.  Cleaned up the use of
   the Mandatory field by creating separate delete and sentcmd fields.

* chkhistory.c chkhistory() - fixed bug which caused no articles to be
	checked, I wasn't passing the current article to my_bsearch().

        chkhistory() - changed HISTORY_FILE to a run time option vice
	the constant defined in the Makefile.

* chkhistory_db.c 
	chkhistory(), open_history() - changed HISTORY_FILE to a
	run_time option.

* killfile.c - added code to handle new killfile option NRXREF.
	This works the same as NRGRPS, but on the Xref line
	instead of the Newsgroups line.

  killfile_done() - fixed bug in freeing perl_int.

  check_a_group() - fixed bug in counting nr of groups.

  pass_two() - fix bug if groupline didn't have group name, we could
	core dump when trying to nuke nl.

* ssort.c - changed params that my_bsearch is called with, to make
	chkhistory faster.  Changed second param to string vice struct.

* suck.c - do_cleanup() - fixed a bug with moving suck.newrc to sucknewsrc.
	If we're restarted with -R, no suck.newrc would exist, and
	we'd move sucknewsrc to sucknewsrc.old, and fail on the
	move of suck.newrc to sucknewsrc.  Now if suck.newrc doesn't
	exist, we don't move sucknewsrc either.

	parse_args() - added code to handle history file option (HF).

* xover.c - added code to handle to option NRXREF, like above.
	Also added code to handle new option XOVER_LOG_LONG,
	which causes suck to format xover kills so that they
	look like message headers, instead of printing just
	the Xover line.

13 Mar 99 - Suck-4.0.0 released

-- Changes from Suck-3.10.3 -> Suck-3.10.4

* active.c - get_message_index_active() - added code to handle -F
	option, reconnect after reading the active file.  This is
	in case of a large active file, and the remote end times
	out while reading it.

* killprg.c - tweaked the #ifdef for the Perl 5.004 stuff

* lmove.c - move_msg(), scan_args() - Added test to see if article
	exists in new location before I move it.  This is to avoid
	overwriting articles if another process adds articles to
	directory without changing the active file.   If an article
	already exists, I abort UNLESS you use the -A option.  See
	man page for more details. 
	
   main() - rewrote tests for msgdir and basedir, to avoid segfaults
	if not defined.

* suck.c - main(), scan_args() - added code to handle -F option.

* xover.c - get_xoverview() - fixed bug in parsing of xoverview, not
	stripping the blanks and nls correctly.  Also fixed bug in
	allocing of memory (had POverview vice Overview).

25 Jan 1999 - Suck-3.10.4 released

-- Changes from Suck-3.10.2 -> Suck-3.10.3

* batch.c - do_post_filter() - created, allows you to edit all articles
	downloaded.

*batch.c - do_lmove_patch()
*killprg.c - killprg_forkit()
*rpost.c - do_filter - added exit(-1) so that if child doesn't execl,
	we don't have both parent and child running.

* chkhistory.c - chkhistory() - changed error_log() call to MyPerror()
	for open of history file, so get more descriptive error msg.

*  suck.c - main(), parse_args() - added arg handling for do_post_filter().

   get_articles(), restart_yn() - re-worked the handling of restarts, to 
	avoid downloading same article twice, or not downloading an article,
	due to the de-duping process when I did a rescan for new articles,
	so I had the same MsgId twice, then deleted the first one already
	downloaded, and then downloaded it again.

* dedupe.c - dedupe_list() - added code so that if one of a set of dupes
	is marked as downloaded, or a dupe, I delete the other one 
	instead, to help avoid the scenario above.	

10 Dec 98  - Suck-3.10.3 released

-- Changes from Suck-3.10.1 -> Suck-3.10.2

* chkhistory.c - chkhistory() - changed to new, hopefully faster routine,
	using ssort() and my_bsearch().

* dedupe.c - dedupe_list() - changed to use  new routine to handle deduping
	based on the ssort() routine.

* ssort.c - created, contains ssort() and my_search().

* suckutils.c - qcmp_msgid() - created for use by my_bsearch().

* xover.c - do_group_xover(), do_one_line() - rewrote to fix bug in 
	not handling multiple group keep/delete files.  

8 Nov 98 - Suck-3.10.2 released

-- Changes from Suck-3.10.0 -> Suck-3.10.1

* chkhistory_db.c - open_history() - fixed typo in GDBM code had == where
	it should have been = .

* killprg.c - added #define ERRSV and PL_na, since Perl 5.004 and earlier
	don't have these.

* rpost.c - main(), scan_args() - modified to handle perl embedded filter.

* rpost.c - parse_perl(), perl_done(), do_perl() - created, handles embedded
	perl subroutine for filtering files uploaded.

* xover.c - get_xoverview() - fix bug in not initializing elements of the
	linked list (next = NULL).

13 Oct 98 - Suck-3.10.1 released

-- Changes from Suck-3.9.4 -> Suck-3.10.0

* both.c  - added tests for <net/socket.h> and <arpa/inet.h> for BEos,
	it needs net/socket.h, everyone else needs the other one.
	
	error_log(), do_debug_vl()  - added code to handle printing of error
        messages to do_debug().

* chkhistory.c - chkhistory() - added code to check for valid lines, since
	INN now has lines that begin with [, used by the DBZ code, and
	we need to ignore them, and use only the lines that start with <.

* chkhistory_db.c - open_history(), close_history() - added code for using
      GDBM database.

* killfile.c - parse_killfile(), do_debug() - changed to pointer and malloc
	for master killfile, so can re-use routine to load in XOVER killfiles.
	Added filename parameter, so can tell it what file to parse.  Changed
	TRUE_STR() macro to use true_str function from suck.c

	parse_a_file() - added initialization of bodybig and bodysmall.

	parse_killfile(), parse_one_file() - changed so that if a killfile
	evaluates to empty, we throw it away, so we don't spend time
	finding groups for empty killfiles.

	parse_killfile(), free_killfile() - changed to set up for embeded
	perl killfile call.

* killprg.c - killperl_setup(), killperl_done(), chk_msg_kill_perl() -
        created, handles calling embedded perl subroutine for killfiles.

* lpost.c - added include <string.h> to fix compile bug on SunOS.

* rpost.c - do_article() - added code to test for a string to confirm
	a duplicate post error message, since some servers don't use
	a separate error code to dilineate these from other failures.

	scan_args() - added call to error_log() so that error_log and 
	MyPerror messages also go to debug.suck, if debug is true.

* suck.c - main(), get_articles(), parse_args() - added code to change the
        format of the BPS and count output to make it easier for a gui to
        pick these out and display separately.  For use in my java gui, 
	or anything else for that matter.  Added arg -G to toggle this on.

	main() - changed calls to true_str() and null_str() from macros
	to true functions, since they are used so much in debug code, so
	as not not have 300 copies of "true" "false" and "null" in the
	program.  Added -f option, to reconnect after deduping the
	messages, in case of long dedupes, and the remote disconnects
	due to time outs.

	main(), parse_args() allocnode(), do_one_group()  - added code to
	handle the new XOVER arg, to parse the xover killfiles, to allow
	passing of article number, and to do the xover() call.

	parse_args() - added call so if debug is set, error_log and MyPerror
        reports to debug.suck.

* testhost.c - main() - added -o option, to list the overview format, which
	is what the XOVER command returns.  Added -M option, in case you
	need the mode reader command for the -o option to work.

* xover.c - created, holds code to process XOVER killfiles.

5 Oct 98 - Suck-3.10.0 released

-- Changes from Suck-3.9.3 -> Suck-3.9.4

* active.c - add_to_list() - added code to do regular expression testing,
       if your system supports regex().
	   - read_ignore() - added code to compile regular expressions if
       your system supports regex().

*chkhistory_db.c - added code to handle INN-2.0's new database routines.

* makephrases.c - count_vars() - rewrote so can't go past end of string
       when checking for a variable.  Added <string.h>.

* suck.c - do_one_group() - changed so abort on non 411,500 error codes
	when sending the group command.

23 Jul 98 - Suck-3.9.4 released

-- Changes from Suck-3.9.2 -> Suck-3.9.3

* suck.c - main() - added code to get reply from "quit" command, that
	way if remote end is in process of sending us something, we
	don't close down the buffer prematurely.

23 Apr 98 - Suck-3.9.3 released

-- Changes from Suck-3.9.1 -> Suck-3.9.2

* As of this version, my e-mail address has changed from boby@pixi.com
to bobyetman@worldnet.att.net.

killprg.c - chk_msg_kill_fork() - added code to handle new -LF option,
	to override built-in default for suck.killlog.

killfile.c - get_chunk_mem() - changed so that if send_command() aborts
	due to TimeOut, we return the actual error (RETVAL_ERROR) vice
	UNEXPECTEDANS which would cause us to keep going.

	regex_scan() - fixed bug if you had were using QUOTECHAR and had
	regex() compiled in.  The regex code would strip the QUOTECHAR
	off the string, so we'd always do case insensitive compare.

	parse_a_file(), regex_scan(), regex_check(), regex_block(), do_debug() - 
	modified to handle new non-regex searching mechanism.  Switched to
	Boyer-Moore algorithm vice straight brute force of strstr() or nstrstr().
	Should make searching of body of messages lots quicker.  Added ability
	to designate string in a killfile as a non-regex.  This is done by adding
	a % to the front of a string, before the QUOTE char.  Added NON_REGEX=
	param to killfiles.  Allows you to specify a character instead of % to
	represent non-regex strings.  Revamped the handling of the QUOTE character,
	it's all done now in regex_scan().  Fixed bug in printing if we were
	using extended regex or not.  Added debugging statements.  

	chk_msg_kill() - added code to handle new -LF option, to override built-in
	default for suck.killlog.

suck.c - do_one_group() - added error message print if timed out getting
	MsgIds.

	do_connect(), send_command() - fixed to handle flushing of inbuf
	and resetting which group number we are on, if reconnect option is 
	given.

	restart_yn() - added -O, skip_on_restart.   Useful when suck is
	having trouble with a particular article, and it keeps timing out
	when you restart.  This option tells suck to skip the first article
	on restart.

29 Mar 98 - Suck-3.9.2 released

-- Changes from Suck-3.9.0 -> Suck-3.9.1

both.c - get_long() - created, copy of number() except it gets
	longs instead of ints.
	str_long() - created copy of str_int() except it gets
	longs instead of ints.  

suck.h - changed so MsgNr is long vice int.  This necessitated a
	bunch of changes in other routines, changing int vars
	to long, and a couple of subroutine calls had to be changed.

12 Feb 98 - Suck-3.9.1 released

	so can handle NULLS in messages.

	sgetline() - added call to do_debug_binary() - so can see
	if I get NULL in recv().

killfile.c - get_one_article_kill() - added code to test if failed to
	write header to disk.  Modified to handle new calling sequence
	for chk_msg_kill*().  Added code to get the body of the article,
	if it wasn't already downloaded in check_a_group().  Added code
	to handle UNEXPECTEDANS from get_chunk_mem.

	chk_msg_kill() - modified to handle new calling sequence, so can
	pass master to check_a_group(), 

	get_chunk_mem() - renamed from get_a_chunk_mem().  Added size param
	to track size of buffer. Changed strcpy() to memmove() in case of nulls
	in string.  Added code to get both the header and body of articles into
	separate buffers.  Added NULL to end of buf so that logging is correct.
	Added code to handle retval and to pass back UNEXPECTANS if the article
	is not available on server.

	check_a_group() - added code to test body and bodysize.  Moved some code
	down to regex_block().  recoded to handle multiple body and header checks.

	bodysize< parameters.  added code to handle multiple header and body checks.
	added code to handle extended regex parameter.

	regex_block() - created.  This code will check an entire block
	(header/body) for the string/regex desired.
	
	debug_one_kill() - created, print OneKill structrure, moved some
	code from print_debug() here to make printouts more uniform and
	code read a bit easier.

	regex_scan() - fixed bug in error message for bad regular expression.
	Added code to free up structure if error in routine.  Added code to
	handle use extended regex parameter.

	pass_one() - added code to handle use extended regex parameter.
	
killprg.c - chk_msg_kill_fork() - modified to handle new calling sequence,
	needed cause chg_msg_kill needed master.

lmove.c - read_active(), rewrite_active() - swap lownr and highnr
	params around to match real format of active.

	load_phrases() - added code to test for correct version nr,
	fixed bug in not skipping ahead to lmove phrases.

	find_groups() - fix bug by changing linein[] to static.

	do_batch() - added code to write rest of articles to failed file
	if we abort due to loss of connection.

suck_config.h - Move DEBUG1 from suck_config.h to Makefile debug_both

suck.c - main() - added TRUE_STR() and NULL_STR() macros to 
	clean up the debugging printout a bit.  Fix bug in errormsg

	to handle -B option, check for any lingering messages and
	batch em up before we start the main run.

	do_supplemental() - added -z option don't do dedupe.  This
	is primarily for real slow machines where the dedupe process
	is longer than the time to download the messages.  I don't
	recommend this option.

	allocnode() - added code to handle -x option, chk_msgid.  If
	this option is set suck doesn't check the end of the MsgId 
	to verify that there is the > that is supposed to be there.
	This is for some brain-dead NNTP servers that truncate
	XHDR info at 72 characters.  Fixed bug introduced when added
	code to get message number that cause the supplemental file
	to not be processed.

	get_a_chunk() - change fputs to fwrite(), to handle NULLs.  Added
	code to test retval of fwrite() in case disk is full.

	load_phrases() - added code to test for correct version nr,

active.c - read_ignore() - move fclose() to prevent attempt to 
	close file that's NULL.

batch.c - batch_lmove() - changed batchfile option to pass the
	configuration file name vice the activefile name.  lmove
	now uses the configuration file to get the activefile name.

killfile.c - parse_a_file() - added code to handle comment character.

lmove.c - main(), rewrite_active(), load_active(), scan_args() -
	added -c option which allows you to specify configuration file
	name.  Rewrote so that active file looks like standard news
	active file, which group name, low, high, and status fields.
	This means I had to move BASE= to another file, the config
	file.  This also loads ACTIVE= to specify the location of
	the active file.
	load_config() - created, loads configuration file.

rpost.c - main(), send_command() - added code to handle the new -u
	option, auto_authenticate.  This option automatically sends
	the authinfo user command upon connect to the remote host.

	do_authenticate() - added, used by -u option.  send_command() and
	do_authenticate() are carbon copies of what is in  suck.c, 
	except for variable name changes.

suck.c - get_one_article() - move output of final '.' so that it
	only happens if the article is successfully downloaded.

	main(), allocnode(), do_free(), do_one_group(), do_supplemental(),
	get_one_article(), get_one_article_kill(), restart_yn(), parse_args() 
	- (wow) Added code to handle -n option.  This option retrieves
	articles by the Number, not by the MessageID.  This means I had to
	track which group each article was in, and send the command to 
	switch groups when needed.  This gets tricky because of the 
	pipelining code, so I can't send ahead if I have to switch groups.
	If your remote NNTP server doesn't send the article number with
	the xhdr command, then this option is disabled in the code.	

	get_group_number() - created, adds group to list and assigns nr
		for later retrieval in -n option.

	build_command() - created, builds head, article, or body command
	with either msgid or msgnr, depending on -n option.

	do_connect, scan_args() - added code to handle the -u, auto_authenticate
	option.  This option will automatically send the authinfo user command
	upon connection.


testhost.c - main() - added code to handle -d option, get group descriptions
	(send command 'list newsgroups').

24 Nov 97 - suck-3.8.0 released

	does both program and man page, fix bug in in installall

sample\* - various tweaks to use new -A and -bp options

active.c - created, handles the -A option, reading in the local
	active file, and merging it with the existing sucknewsrc
	to get the msgids.

	of timeout value from all the programs.

batch.c - created, moved all batch subroutines here.  
	- do_localpost(), post_one_msg() - created, post articles

	- do_one_group() - created.
	- get_articles() - redid code that prints BPS to use new
	GET_BPS function from the timercode, so that I can correctly
	format the output and don't get BPSS type stuff.  Added code
	to handle BATCH_LIHAVE file open.
	- get_one_article(), main(), added code for BATCH_LIHAVE
	- do_rnewsbatch(), do_innbatch, do_lmovebatch() - moved to batch.c
	- scan_args() - rewritten to handle long and short args

19 Oct 97 - suck-3.7.0 released

-- Changes to Suck-3.5.2
*.c - removed all ifdef TIMER this option is no longer needed,
	now that the -q is present.

both.c - added test for NULL fpo to print_phrases().

killfile.c - changed all routines, got rid of non-regex stuff,
	and rewrote to handle new killfile format and parameters.
	Changed get_one_article_kill() to put tmp message into
	TMPDIR not MSGDIR.  Added -k option to ignore postfix
	for master killfile so can have one set of killfiles for multiple
	feeds.  Changed so the killfile names in the GROUP lines
	are absolute, and don't get prefix added on.
	Changed so killfile log only opened once, and changed log 
	format, added long and short version, and it also prints
	out which string we matched on.  Added wildcard matching
	to the group matching routine (so can match comp.os.linux*).
	Handle space instead of comma for separator on newsgroup line.
	Added code to handle batch infeed option.  Added test for
	regex or non-regex, so can use faster strstr() if not regex.
	Fixed bug so that if killfile don't exist, we just ignore it.

killprg.c - chk_msg_fork_kill() - added logging to killfile log.
	Added various debugging statements, to help determine
	problems with child programs.
	- move #include <unistd.h> before the <dirent.h>, needs to
	be this order for FreeBSD.
	- chk_msg_kill_fork() - added new logging code in.

suck.c - get_announcements() - added code to handle authentication.
	renamed to do_connect(), moved connect code down here, to allow
	for disconnect and reconnect every X msgs (to combat the inn
	LIKE_PULLERS=DONT option)
         send_command() - moved code for authentication to separate
	function.
         do_authenticate() - created to handle all authentication
	requests.
	 scan_args() - re-organized so options in alphabetic order,
	so easier to figure out which letters are used.
	 get_msg_index() - added # of msgs to the print out of the
	which articles are being downloaded.
	main() 
	get_articles() - moved parsing of killfiles to main(), made
	 killp part of master structure.  Added code to handle -C option
	(reconnect every x msgs).  Added code to handle batch innfeed 
	option.

	get_one_article() _ changed to create tmp msg file in
	TMPDIR not MSGDIR, so rnews can feed directly off of MSGDIR.
        do_rnewsbatch(), do_innbatch() - changed so gathers all articles
	with the proper postfix.  This is needed in case a restart gets
	more articles and the numbering changes.  This means if you are
	NOT using a postfix, you'll need to make sure there is nothing
	else in the MSGDIR but the msgs, since we'll match on all files.
	Fixed bug in not printing ".\n" at end of message in stdout 
	mode.  Added code to handle batch innfeed option.

	main() - moved code to set up master.msgs to stdout or stderr
	to before lock_file() call, so that if in stdout mode, we 
	print messages correctly.

suckutils.c - move_file() - change typo in write from fpi to fpo.
	- tmp_path() - removed as was causing a bug in renaming the
	tmp articles back to the real names.

	  article, it doesn't abort, just goes on to the
	  next article.

		hopefully will speed up large message downloads.
       - get_message_index() - Added code to handle maxread
		parameter in sucknewsrc.  Added check for count
       		on group line, so if no messages available we
		don't even try.

suckutils.c - do_lockfile() - change so PMaster is passed so 
	can print to status log.  Change print of removing
	stale lock file from errlog to status log, since this

	       easier maintenance.

	     - chkhistory() - there is now an experimental version 
	       of the flat file history checker.  If you define

			  - is now in killfile.c
	 - main()
	 - rnews_batch() - added -r option, and the ability to build multiple batch

29 Dec 95    - suck-2.5.1 released

--Changes to Suck-2.5

		read the list into memory on a restart.  Also fixed handling of 
		stdout/stderr for status & error messages if in multifile mode or not.

suck.c	   - do_innbatch()
	   - do_rnewsbatch() - changed to use readdir() to build article files

		    - added lockfile stuff
	   - do_lockfile()  - created, Hope this is portable 	
	   - get_message_index() - any nr < 0 will cause us to just update sucknewsrc
			 	 - with the new high article nr (to start a newgroup)
	   			 - any line beginning with a # will be skipped
	   - get_messages() - added call to free_killfile()
	   - do_supplemental() - redid status messages a bit, added call to chkhistory()
	
killfile.h - added free_killfile() definition, added to KillStruct 

killfile.c - get_a_chunk_mem()  - modified to handle double dots IAW RFC 977 2.4.1

get.news.innxmit -  created, for use by INND
                 - changed to use flush vice reload for ctlinnd
get.news.rnews - created, for use by CNEWS
testhost.c - added #include "config.h"

timer.c    - changed message printout to include mins and seconds
	   - added TIMER_TIMEONLY option to just disply time, not bytes

		so errors in upload got passed back.

suck.c    - main() 
	    get_articles() - added -s option, to force display of the status
	   	message for each message to stderr vice stdout.  That way

			   - articles that will NOT be checked against killfile stuff
			   - Now suck.sorted has two fields per line, msgnr and a
			   - one char field that states whether or not I must download
			   - this article. If I must, I will bypass killfile routines.
